## 1) Introduction
Operations is where **AI meets reality**. Without disciplined ops, even the smartest AI fails in production. CRAudioVizAI must treat ops as a **Fortune 500-level function** from day one.

## 2) Philosophy
- **Reliability = trust.**  
- **Ops = culture, not just tech.**  
- **If it’s not documented, it didn’t happen.**

## 3) Core Ops Processes
- Change management.  
- Incident response.  
- Release management.  
- Access control.

## 4) Monitoring & Observability
- Logs, metrics, traces.  
- Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack.  
- Alert fatigue vs. smart alerts.

## 5) Incident Response Playbook
- Detect → Triage → Contain → Resolve → Postmortem.  
- Roles: Incident commander, comms lead, ops lead.  
- CRAudioVizAI: Roy/Cindy for approvals.

## 6) Common Ops Failures
- Server down → restart, failover.  
- Database lock → kill transaction, rollback.  
- API timeout → retry with backoff.  
- Disk full → cleanup + alerts.

## 7) Troubleshooting Framework
- Define the problem.  
- Check monitoring dashboards.  
- Isolate scope (network, DB, app).  
- Test hypotheses.  
- Apply fix.  
- Document in Build Journal.

## 8) Infrastructure Management
- Hostinger dev, Squarespace prod (temporary).  
- Move to cloud as revenue scales.  
- IaC for reproducibility.

## 9) CI/CD Discipline
- GitHub → dev → test → prod.  
- Mandatory backups before deploy.  
- Canary releases for safety.

## 10) Secrets & Config
- Stored in vault + local ini files.  
- Rotate keys regularly.  
- Audit logs for compliance.

## 11) Security Incidents
- Prompt injection, exfiltration attempts.  
- Response = revoke keys, isolate system, patch.  
- Report if required by law.

## 12) Backups & Recovery
- Regular DB + file backups.  
- Test restores.  
- Air-gapped copies for disaster recovery.

## 13) Scaling & Performance
- Auto-scaling policies.  
- Load tests before big launches.  
- Cache to cut costs.

## 14) Cost Management
- Monitor cloud bills.  
- Free tier first, scale after ROI.  
- Kill zombie resources.

## 15) Documentation & Runbooks
- Standard templates.  
- Every incident logged.  
- Training = repeatable results.

## 16) CRAudioVizAI Framework
- Build Journal = single source of truth.  
- Ops AI agent → propose fixes, escalate approvals.  
- KPI: uptime %, MTTR, incidents/month.

## 17) Grant Implications
- Funders value resilience.  
- Grants for cybersecurity, digital safety, reliability.  

## 18) Roadmap
- Phase 1: monitoring + backups.  
- Phase 2: incident playbooks + automation.  
- Phase 3: AI-ops integration (Javari self-heal).

## 19) Conclusion
Ops = **credibility + survival**. CRAudioVizAI must be Fortune 500 in ops before revenue is Fortune 500.
