Project: CRAudioVizAI — main customer-facing website (marketing) + hooks for dashboard later.

Goal (MVP for this Repl):

Public marketing site with hero, product explainer, CTAs, and working routing.

Pages: Home, About, Solutions, Pricing, RSS (stub), “Meet Javari” page with link to external app.

Components: Header, Footer, Social bar, Email capture form (POST /api/subscribe stub).

Responsive, clean UI with Tailwind.

Core functionality (website):

Static/SSR Next.js pages

Email capture (POST stub now; we’ll later forward to CRM)

Nav + mobile menu

Placeholder images/slots for avatars & brand

SEO basics (title/description)

AI components (for later):

None required in website MVP. Just link out to Javari at https://javariai.com via NEXT_PUBLIC_JAVARI_APP_URL.

User interface:

Modern, minimal design; sticky header; hero + CTA; sections for “Avatar World”, “Products in progress”

Color: neutral gray/white; accent black/blue

Mobile-first responsive

Technical preferences:

Frontend: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

API stubs: Next.js route handlers under /api

Env var: NEXT_PUBLIC_JAVARI_APP_URL=https://javariai.com

Assets: /public/brand/logo.png, /public/avatars/{javari,kairo,crai}.png (placeholders OK)

Routing structure:

/ → marketing home

/company/about

/solutions

/pricing

/rss (stub list)

/javari (intro page + button to external app)

/app/redirect (client page that redirects to NEXT_PUBLIC_JAVARI_APP_URL)

/api/subscribe (POST stub → returns {ok:true})

Acceptance criteria:

Running dev server shows Home with hero + buttons (“Meet Javari”, “Learn more about us”)

Nav links work without 404

/api/subscribe returns 200 JSON on POST

Mobile menu works
