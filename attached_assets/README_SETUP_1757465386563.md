# Secure Access Setup for Javari

This folder contains templates to grant **Javari** controlled access to your services **without** sharing secrets in chat.

## Files
- `crav.ini` (template): Fill with API keys/tokens and place locally on your PC and server.
- `policies.yaml`: Role-based access control (RBAC), approvals, budgets, and crawl rules.

## Install Paths
- Windows: `C:\CRAV\secrets\crav.ini`
- Linux (Hostinger): `/home/<user>/.secrets/crav.ini`

## Minimal Scopes (Least Privilege)
- **Google Drive**: Service Account with `drive.readonly` and share only the *safe* folder.
- **GitHub**: PAT with `repo` scope (or read-only deploy keys).
- **Mailchimp**: API key scoped to your audience.
- **Stripe/PayPal**: Test keys first; lock webhooks to your domain.
- **Zapier**: Use webhooks for fan-out; keep per-flow secrets in Zapier.
- **Social**: Prefer Buffer/Hypefury for posting aggregation to avoid many platform tokens.

## Approval Flow
High-risk actions (deploys, payment changes, new OAuth connections) require a one-time code from Roy or Cindy. Configure the method in `policies.yaml`.

## Next
1) Copy `crav.ini` template and fill values.
2) Upload to the secure paths above.
3) Confirm back here and we’ll wire Javari’s services to use it.
