**Version:** v1.0  
**Last updated:** 2025-09-05 (America/New_York)  
**Primary audience:** Internal leadership, investors, grant reviewers  
**Author:** CRAudioVizAI (Roy Henderson, CEO)

## Executive Summary
CRAudioVizAI’s technology stack is designed to be **low-cost at the start**, **scalable over time**, and **aligned with enterprise discipline**. This roadmap shows the transition from lean infrastructure to Fortune‑500‑grade systems as Javari grows and revenue/grants scale.


---
## Current Lean Stack (2025)
- **Hosting:** Hostinger (VPS/shared) — FastAPI + Postgres/pgvector.  
- **Database:** Postgres with pgvector extension for embeddings.  
- **Storage:** Hostinger filesystem for blob/doc storage.  
- **Scheduler:** Hostinger cron for hourly ingest pipeline.  
- **Version Control:** GitHub (private repo).  
- **Secrets:** Local `.ini` files only (Roy/Cindy controlled).  
- **Automation:** Zapier free tier, Mailchimp starter, Supabase free.  
- **Avatars:** Akool (visual), ElevenLabs (voice).  
- **Design:** Canva, Figma.  
- **Comms:** Discord, Threads, Slack (internal use optional).


---
## Near-Term Stack (Trigger: Early Revenue or Initial Grants)
- **Storage Upgrade:** Migrate from Hostinger filesystem → S3-compatible storage (Wasabi, Backblaze).  
- **Database Upgrade:** Move to managed vector DB (Qdrant, Weaviate).  
- **Observability:** Basic logging/monitoring (Grafana, Prometheus).  
- **Payment Integration:** Stripe + PayPal live for one-time + subscription billing.  
- **CRM/Analytics:** Light CRM (HubSpot starter or Pipedrive), GA4, Search Console.  
- **Automation Expansion:** Paid Zapier/Buffer tier for more integrations.  
- **Security:** SSL everywhere, 2FA for admin access.


---
## Mid-Term Stack (Trigger: >1,000 MAUs / >100 SMBs)
- **Scaling Compute:** Cloud-native deployment (Docker/Kubernetes on AWS/GCP/Azure).  
- **CDN:** For avatar videos, app static files, and global reach.  
- **Advanced CRM:** HubSpot Pro or Salesforce (for enterprise accounts).  
- **App Ecosystem:** Dedicated app area with free/paid tools, managed via backend.  
- **Data Layer:** Supabase or Firebase for user accounts + lightweight auth.  
- **Monitoring:** Real-time alerts, error reporting (Sentry, Datadog).  
- **API Layer:** Tiered APIs for enterprise integrations.


---
## Long-Term Stack (Trigger: >10K MAUs / Enterprise Contracts)
- **Full Cloud Migration:** Dedicated clusters with redundancy and auto-scaling.  
- **Compliance:** SOC2, HIPAA (for healthcare pilots), GDPR (global).  
- **Enterprise Integrations:** SAP, Oracle, enterprise-scale APIs.  
- **AI Enhancements:** Fine-tuned models, self-healing ingestion, autonomy loops.  
- **Avatar World Scaling:** Dedicated servers for immersive, persistent avatar spaces (Unity/WebGL/VR).  
- **Marketplace:** Paid app store within Avatar World.  
- **Analytics Suite:** Enterprise-grade BI dashboards (Tableau, Superset).


---
## Guiding Principles
- **Cost Discipline:** Only scale infra when revenue/grants support.  
- **Portability:** Use open standards (pgvector, Docker) to avoid lock-in.  
- **Security First:** Least-privilege keys, encrypted secrets, mandatory backups.  
- **Automation:** Every upgrade adds more automation (ingest, posting, monitoring).  
- **Grant Alignment:** Highlight scalability + efficiency in proposals.


---
## Summary
This roadmap ensures CRAudioVizAI evolves from **lean startup stack → enterprise stack** without waste. Javari grows stronger every hour, while infrastructure grows only as justified by **user traction, revenue, and grants**.
